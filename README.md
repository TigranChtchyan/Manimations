# Manim

In each folder there is a readme file, in which is written what are the animations in that folder's .py files.

To use funtions from Functions/Directory/file.py, write
```py
from Functions.Directory.file import *
```

To run .py file just type 'manim -pql file_name.py scene_name' in the terminal.

To make it work the computer must have manimCE installed.
